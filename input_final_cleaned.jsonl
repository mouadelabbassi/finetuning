{"prompt": "What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?", "response": "Supervised learning uses labeled data where the model learns from input-output pairs, like classification or regression tasks. Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data to find patterns, structures, or groupings, such as clustering or dimensionality reduction. The key difference is that supervised learning has a target variable to predict, while unsupervised learning discovers hidden structures without predefined labels."}
{"prompt": "Explain the concept of RLHF in AI model training.", "response": "RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) is a technique used to align AI models with human preferences. It involves three stages: first, training a base model with supervised learning; second, collecting human feedback on model outputs to train a reward model; and third, using reinforcement learning (typically PPO) to optimize the base model against the reward model. This approach helps create models that generate more helpful, harmless, and honest responses."}
{"prompt": "What are the main considerations when designing an embedded system?", "response": "Key considerations include: power consumption and energy efficiency, real-time performance requirements, memory constraints (RAM and ROM), processing capabilities, I/O interfaces, environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, vibration), cost constraints, reliability and fault tolerance, development and debugging tools, and scalability. You must also consider the hardware-software co-design, interrupt handling, and whether to use an RTOS or bare-metal programming."}
