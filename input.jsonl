{"prompt": "Explain the difference between classification and regression", "completion": "Classification predicts discrete categorical labels (e.g., spam/not spam), while regression predicts continuous numerical values (e.g., house prices). Classification outputs classes, regression outputs numbers."}
{"prompt": "What is overfitting in machine learning?", "completion": "Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and outliers, leading to poor generalization on new data. The model performs well on training data but poorly on test data. Solutions include regularization, cross-validation, and using more training data."}
{"prompt": "What is the bias-variance tradeoff?", "completion": "The bias-variance tradeoff is the balance between a model's ability to minimize bias (error from incorrect assumptions) and variance (error from sensitivity to training data fluctuations). High bias leads to underfitting, high variance to overfitting. The goal is finding the sweet spot."}
{"prompt": "Explain cross-validation", "completion": "Cross-validation is a technique to evaluate model performance by splitting data into multiple folds. K-fold cross-validation divides data into k subsets, training on k-1 folds and validating on the remaining fold, repeated k times. This provides robust performance estimates."}
{"prompt": "What is regularization in ML?", "completion": "Regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function to prevent overfitting by discouraging complex models. Common types include L1 (Lasso) which promotes sparsity, and L2 (Ridge) which penalizes large weights. It helps improve generalization."}
{"prompt": "What is a confusion matrix?", "completion": "A confusion matrix is a table showing the performance of a classification model, displaying true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. It helps calculate metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy."}
{"prompt": "Explain precision vs recall", "completion": "Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions (TP / (TP + FP)), while recall measures the coverage of actual positives (TP / (TP + FN)). High precision minimizes false positives, high recall minimizes false negatives. F1-score balances both."}
{"prompt": "What is gradient descent?", "completion": "Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that iteratively adjusts model parameters to minimize the loss function. It calculates the gradient (derivative) of the loss and updates parameters in the opposite direction, moving toward the minimum."}
{"prompt": "What are hyperparameters?", "completion": "Hyperparameters are configuration settings set before training (e.g., learning rate, batch size, number of layers) that control the learning process. Unlike model parameters learned during training, hyperparameters require tuning through techniques like grid search or Bayesian optimization."}
{"prompt": "What is feature engineering?", "completion": "Feature engineering is the process of creating, transforming, and selecting features from raw data to improve model performance. Techniques include normalization, encoding categorical variables, creating interaction terms, and domain-specific transformations."}
{"prompt": "Explain ensemble methods", "completion": "Ensemble methods combine multiple models to improve predictions. Bagging (e.g., Random Forest) reduces variance by training models on random subsets. Boosting (e.g., XGBoost) sequentially trains models to correct previous errors. Stacking combines different model types."}
{"prompt": "What is Random Forest?", "completion": "Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode (classification) or mean (regression) of individual trees. It reduces overfitting through randomization and averaging, providing robust predictions."}
{"prompt": "What is XGBoost?", "completion": "XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is an optimized gradient boosting algorithm that builds trees sequentially, with each tree correcting errors of previous ones. It includes regularization, handles missing values, and supports parallel processing, making it highly effective for structured data."}
{"prompt": "Explain k-means clustering", "completion": "K-means is an unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions data into k clusters by iteratively assigning points to the nearest centroid and updating centroids. It minimizes within-cluster variance but requires specifying k and is sensitive to initialization."}
{"prompt": "What is PCA?", "completion": "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms data into a new coordinate system where the greatest variance lies on the first coordinates (principal components). It's used for visualization, noise reduction, and feature extraction."}
{"prompt": "What is the curse of dimensionality?", "completion": "The curse of dimensionality refers to problems that arise when working with high-dimensional data: exponential growth in data sparsity, increased computational cost, and difficulty in finding meaningful patterns. Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA help mitigate this."}
{"prompt": "What is a ROC curve?", "completion": "A ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve plots True Positive Rate vs False Positive Rate at various classification thresholds. The area under the curve (AUC-ROC) measures model performance: AUC = 1 is perfect, AUC = 0.5 is random guessing."}
{"prompt": "Explain batch normalization", "completion": "Batch normalization normalizes layer inputs across a mini-batch, stabilizing and accelerating training. It reduces internal covariate shift, allows higher learning rates, and acts as regularization (deep packet inspection, IPS). Can be hardware or software."}
{"prompt": "What is data augmentation?", "completion": "Data augmentation artificially increases training data by applying transformations that preserve labels. For images: rotation, flipping, cropping, color changes. For text: synonym replacement, back-translation. It improves model generalization and reduces overfitting."}
{"prompt": "What is early stopping?", "completion": "Early stopping is a regularization technique that halts training when validation performance stops improving, preventing overfitting. It monitors validation loss or accuracy and restores the best model weights from the epoch with optimal validation performance."}
{"prompt": "What is a neural network?", "completion": "A neural network is a computational model inspired by biological neurons, consisting of interconnected layers of nodes (neurons).
