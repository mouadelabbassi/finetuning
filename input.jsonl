{"prompt":"Explain the difference between classification and regression", "response":"Classification predicts discrete categorical labels (e.g., spam/not spam), while regression predicts continuous numerical values (e.g., house prices). Classification outputs classes, regression outputs numbers."}
{"prompt":"What is overfitting in machine learning?", "response":"Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and outliers, leading to poor generalization on new data. The model performs well on training data but poorly on test data. Solutions include regularization, cross-validation, and using more training data."}
{"prompt":"What is the bias-variance tradeoff?", "response":"The bias-variance tradeoff is the balance between a model's ability to minimize bias (error from incorrect assumptions) and variance (error from sensitivity to training data fluctuations). High bias leads to underfitting, high variance to overfitting. The goal is finding the sweet spot."}

{"prompt":"What is transfer learning?", "response":"Transfer learning leverages knowledge from a pre-trained model on one task to improve performance on another related task. Common approach:use a model pre-trained on large datasets (e.g., ImageNet) as a feature extractor or fine-tune it on your specific task with limited data."}
{"prompt":"Explain fine-tuning vs feature extraction", "response":"Feature extraction freezes pre-trained layers and only trains new layers for your task, fast but limited adaptation. Fine-tuning unfreezes some/all pre-trained layers and continues training on your data, allowing deeper adaptation but requires more data and computation."}
{"prompt":"What is dropout?", "response":"Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly deactivates neurons during training with probability p (typically 0.5). This prevents co-adaptation of neurons, reduces overfitting, and creates an ensemble effect. At inference, all neurons are active but scaled by (1-p)."}
{"prompt":"What is batch size and how does it affect training?", "response":"Batch size is the number of samples processed before updating weights. Larger batches:more stable gradients, better GPU utilization, but require more memory and may converge to sharper minima. Smaller batches:noisier gradients, act as regularization, better generalization, slower training."}
